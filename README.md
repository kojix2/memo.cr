- This project was made to explore how to build and distribute apps with Crystal and WebView in a simple and practical way.

- Itâ€™s not meant to be a serious note-taking app, though I do plan to use it from time to time myself.

## Installation

```sh
shards build --release -Dpreview_mt -Dexecution_context
```

## Usage

```
bin/memo
```
